# Pneumonia Detection

## ü©∫ Project Overview

This project is a deep learning‚Äìbased image classification system designed to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. It is built using the TensorFlow deep learning framework and wrapped in a beautiful, professional Flask-based web interface. Users can upload chest X-ray images and receive real-time predictions regarding the presence of pneumonia.

Pneumonia is a **serious respiratory infection** that causes **inflammation in the alveoli (air sacs)** of the lungs, often leading them to fill with fluid or pus. It can be caused by **bacteria**, **viruses**, or **fungi**, with **Streptococcus pneumoniae** being the most common bacterial cause. Pneumonia primarily affects **infants**, **elderly individuals**, and people with weakened immune systems, and if not diagnosed and treated early, it can result in severe complications or even death.

Traditionally, pneumonia is diagnosed using chest X-rays interpreted by radiologists. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming, error-prone, and may not be readily available in resource-constrained settings. This is where **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** come into play.

Deep learning, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, has shown immense success in processing medical images. By training on large datasets of chest X-ray images, CNNs can learn to automatically detect patterns associated with pneumonia ‚Äî such as lung opacity, consolidation, or pleural effusion ‚Äî which are often subtle and difficult to spot with the naked eye.

In this project, we utilize **Transfer Learning**, specifically **Xception** model (a high-performing CNN architecture), to classify X-ray images into two categories:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**

This automated tool not only improves diagnostic speed and accuracy but also assists healthcare professionals by acting as a **second-opinion system**, thereby reducing workload and increasing confidence in clinical settings. Furthermore, by deploying the model as a Flask web application, it becomes accessible for both local and remote usage, making it a useful tool in **telemedicine** and **mobile healthcare solutions**.


## üìä Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated using standard metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Loss**
- **Validation Accuracy**
- **Validation Loss**

We also used **ROC-AUC** to evaluate and determine the optimal classification threshold.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset used is a labeled collection of **chest X-ray images** divided into:
- `Normal`
- `Pneumonia`
